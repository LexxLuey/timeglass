# TimeGlass Roadmap

This document outlines our planned development milestones and future features for TimeGlass. We're committed to building a comprehensive profiling tool for FastAPI applications while maintaining our focus on simplicity and performance.

## Current Status

TimeGlass is in early development. We've defined the core architecture and are working towards the initial release.

## Roadmap Overview

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Q4 2025)
**Goal:** Establish the fundamental profiling capabilities.

- [ ] **Rust Profiling Engine**: Implement the core Rust-based profiling engine with minimal overhead
- [ ] **FastAPI Middleware**: Create the `TimeGlassMiddleware` for seamless integration
- [ ] **Basic Metrics Collection**: Implement collection of latency, CPU, memory, and database query metrics
- [ ] **Data Storage**: Set up SQLite-based local storage for profiling data

### Phase 2: User Interface (Q1 2026)
**Goal:** Provide an intuitive way for developers to view and analyze profiling data.

- [ ] **Web Dashboard**: Build the self-hosted web application for visualizing metrics
- [ ] **Requests List View**: Implement the filterable table of recent requests
- [ ] **Basic Detailed View**: Create summary cards and timeline views for individual requests
- [ ] **CLI Tool**: Develop the `timeglass` command-line interface

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Q2 2026)
**Goal:** Enhance analysis capabilities and user experience.

- [ ] **Database Query Analysis**: Add detailed SQL query monitoring and timing
- [ ] **Flame Graphs**: Implement visual call tree representations
- [ ] **Benchmark Scoring**: Add automated scoring against performance benchmarks
- [ ] **Export Functionality**: Allow exporting profiling data in various formats

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration (Q3 2026)
**Goal:** Expand compatibility and integrations.

- [ ] **Additional Database Support**: Extend support beyond asyncpg and SQLAlchemy
- [ ] **Framework Integrations**: Consider integrations with other async frameworks
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: Provide ways to integrate profiling into development pipelines
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Create an extensible plugin architecture

### Phase 5: Production Readiness (Q4 2026)
**Goal:** Prepare for broader adoption and production use cases.

- [ ] **Configuration Management**: Advanced configuration options and environment-specific settings
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Further reduce profiling overhead
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**: Achieve high test coverage and robust testing infrastructure
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete user and developer documentation

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/timeglass.git
cd timeglass
```

### Set Up Development Environment

1. **Install Poetry (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. **Clone and set up the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/timeglass.git
   cd timeglass
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Install Rust (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
   ```

4. **Build the Rust extension:**

## Code Style

We follow these coding standards:

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 style guidelines. Use `black` for code formatting and `flake8` for linting.
- **Rust**: Follow the official Rust style guidelines. Use `rustfmt` for formatting and `clippy` for linting.
- **Commits**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages. Use conventional commits format (e.g., `feat: add new feature`, `fix: resolve bug`).

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. Install them with:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- Aim for good test coverage, especially for critical components.

Run the test suite:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

For coverage report:

```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=timeglass --cov-report=html
```
